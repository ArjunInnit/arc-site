## Aim

To make a dustbin that will open when you hover your hand over it.

## Requirements

- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasound Sensor
- Servo motor (operating voltage: 6V DC , torque: 3.5 Kg.cm)
- Battery (12V 3AH)
- Jumper Cables
- A foot pedal Dustbin
- Breadboard

## Details

The ultrasound sensor is connected to the front of the dustbin and the servo is attached to a lever in the back which is a part of the foot pedal mechanism. A code is uploaded into the arduino which is used to accept inputs from the ultrasound sensor and direct the movements of the servo. The arduino is powered by the battery.

  <div class="swiper__button swiper__button--next fas fa-chevron-right"></div>
</div>

Hence the dustbin is opened using the servo when an object hovers over it and is similarly closed when the object is removed.
