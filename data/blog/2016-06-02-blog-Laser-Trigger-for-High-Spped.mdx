## Aim

Capturing moment that whiz past your naked eyes by setting a laser to trigger a camera via Arduino .

## Hardware used

- Arduino
- 3.3V LASER
- Light Dependent Resistor
- NPN Transistor
- Camera/Flash

## Details

The camera was setup on BULB mode (the sensor would remain open till the shutter wasnâ€™t pressed again) and all the lights of the room were switched off. Since it was a dark room only the light of the flash would be visible on the final image. Hence, the flashes (2) were fired by the laser trigger not the camera. Camera shutter was manually set. A speaker was put between the laser and LDR. Black plastic was put over the speaker and little drops of paint were put using a syringe. The paint drops would fly once the music was turned on. The flying paint would obstruct the laser beam and flashes would be fired. Then the camera shutter was closed..
