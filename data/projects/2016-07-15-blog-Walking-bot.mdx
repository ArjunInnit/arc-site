## Aim

The aim is to mimic the walking of an animal and make a mechanical walking replica of it.

## Materials Used

Parts from mechanix kit were used so that it could all fit together well.

## Working

There is a constant phase difference between the bot which is always maintained.This phase ensures that while one half of the legs are moving
backwards it doesnâ€™t touch the ground and is lifted in the air while the other set of legs push the bot forward.
