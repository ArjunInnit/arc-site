## Details

The vehicle is controlled wirelessly by a keyboard through Bluetooth. It moves to a particular area of choice, and when given a command, it orients to the spatial position where it receives maximum amount of light. (Designed for a solar panel).It has 2 degrees of freedom, 1 horizontal, and 1 vertical. The tolerance value and speed can be controlled using potentiometers.
