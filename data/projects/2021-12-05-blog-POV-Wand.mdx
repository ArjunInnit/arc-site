## Aim

Making a Presistence of Vision Wand

## Story

# POV Wand

## About this project

POV (Persistence of Vision) is a kind of optical illusion in which a visual image seems to persist even when the light from it ceases to enter our eyes. This can be used to make POV displays where we can display text, images, gifs, etc.
